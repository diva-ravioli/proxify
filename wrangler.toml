# KV namespace for storing tokens and user data
# Note: The KV namespace ID is set dynamically during deployment.
# Do NOT hardcode IDs here - they are account-specific.
# The deployment workflow/script will create the namespace and inject the ID.
# For local development, run: npx wrangler kv:namespace create SPOTIFY_DATA
# Then paste the resulting id below.
# [[kv_namespaces]]
# binding = "SPOTIFY_DATA"
# id = "<your-kv-namespace-id>"

# Environment variables (set these via wrangler secret put)

# For deployment, you'll need to set these secrets via Cloudflare Dashboard:
# API_KEY - Your secure API key for authentication
# SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID - Your Spotify app's Client ID
# SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET - Your Spotify app's Client Secret

# All secrets can be set via the Cloudflare Dashboard:
# Workers & Pages → Your Worker → Settings → Variables → Add variable (with Encrypt checked)
